## üìù Description
A website providing leaderboards and player stats for Halo: Master Chief Collection.

## üí° Problem
There was no way for users to view or track other player's stats on the game Halo: Master Chief Collection because there was no supported api's by 343i that fansites could use to provide this service. Although [**HaloWaypoint**](https://www.halowaypoint.com/) provided the stats, accessing them was challenging as users were required to log in to their Xbox accounts

## üî® Solution
Given that [**HaloWaypoint**](https://www.halowaypoint.com/) had player stats, the approach involved logging in to obtain the authentication token, which was then used to load the site with the desired stats. I utilized the Python library [**Beautiful Soup**](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to scrape and extract the necessary stats, which were subsequently stored in a MySql database. This facilitated a more convenient way for users to access their own stats as well as those of others.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
* I no longer own the domain mccstats.com, therefore the site was moved to [**mccstats.site**](https://www.mccstats.site/).
* [**HaloWaypoint**](https://www.halowaypoint.com/) had a huge overhaul of their website and the api no longer exist.
* The site no longer displays real-time player stats, but it offers valuable historical data.

## ‚ú® Highlights
* Displays individual player stats, progression, and current rank.
* Shows individual leaderboards for each respective category.
* Hosted seasonal leaderboards that displayed players progress and stats that they accumulated throughout the season.
* Pulls recent Xbox clips from any player that has their privacy turned on.
* Consitantly pulled over [**1 Million Hits**](https://twitter.com/MccStats/status/1289617124814499844) per month
